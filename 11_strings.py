"""
In this exercise, we are going to learn about Python strings.
In order to define a string in python, we can use both single quotes
and double quotes to define a string.

What is a string?
String is a collection of characters.

But there are times you have to use a specific form.
Normally, we use single/double quote(s) to define a string but what if
we want to write or make a string of multiple lengths.
Like a message that we use it to send in email, then we can use triple
quotes.
